> There are two kinds of types in the Java programming language: primitive types (§4.2) and reference types (§4.3). There are, correspondingly, two kinds of data values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned by methods, and operated on: primitive values (§4.2) and reference values (§4.3).

> An object is a class instance or an array.  
> The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects, and a special null reference, which refers to no object.
